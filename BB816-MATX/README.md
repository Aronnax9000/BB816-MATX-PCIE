# BB816-MATX

A mATX (Micro-ATX) form factor system board for Adrien Kohlbecker's [BB816](https://github.com/adrienkohlbecker/BB816) Breakout Board, rev. A27.

This project adapts an [ATX layout](https://github.com/theguydanish/CM4_MATX) created by Oliver MÃ¸ller for the (archived) CM4_MATX project.

In addition to the breakout board connector, the system board provides four bus connectors of the type used for PCIExpress x16 add-on cards, and an ATX power supply connector.
